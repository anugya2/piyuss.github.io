Hello! I am a doctoral student at North Carolina State University working towards a dual PhD in Engineering and Forestry. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's degree in Biological and Agricultural Systems Engineering. I am interested in the application of computer vision and robotics to biological systems. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

__Hyperspectral image analysis for phenotyping of loblolly pine:__    
In this project, we are studying the possibility of detecting biological stress in loblolly pine seedlings using VIS-NIR imaging.
